# Shopping Cart 
This is the final project from The Odin Project's React coarse. The goal of this project is to build a fake e-commerce store using react and Fake Store API. The fake store consists of 4 main pages(Home, About, Products, and the Checkout Cart screen). This site was made using React + Vite.
